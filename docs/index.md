We are going to build the same application using AWS SAM and CDK, learning along the way the differences between the two IaC tools.

## Target Audience
* Individuals with development experience, preferably in Python, although Python knowledge is not mandatory.
* Those who have worked with AWS services in the past and possess an AWS environment for use.
* People who have some experience with serverless services such as AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
